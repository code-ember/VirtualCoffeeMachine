# VirtualCoffeeMachine
Creating multiple classes with Java

## Introduction
Well done on getting this far in this module OOP basics. This lab combines the joy of coffee with the power of OOP. By the end of this lab, youâ€™ll be able to create classes that represent various coffee beverages using inheritance. You'll gain an understanding of how attributes and methods are shared across a class hierarchy, allowing for efficient code reuse. Additionally, you'll learn to utilize common methods in a superclass, enhancing the reusability and organization of your code.

Imagine you are a software developer hired by a company to work on a virtual coffee machine project. As a team member, your task is to develop a system that enables the application to brew various types of coffee. The machine needs to simulate the preparation of different coffee beverages, such as espresso and latte, each with unique characteristics. The machine should recognize different coffee beverages as objects inherited from a Coffee superclass.

## Goal
Design and implement a coffee hierarchy using inheritance to represent different coffee beverages (Latte, Espresso) while capturing shared attributes and functionalities.
